My Portfolio

This is my first portfolio version built with html, css, and Bootstrap.

I am a student at the UNCC Coding Bootcamp through Trilogy. 
This is my second homework assignment meant to show responsive page design and basic knowledge of css and how to utilize Bootstrap.

Thank you to my instructor, Trilogy, and UNCC as well as the developers of Bootstrap.
