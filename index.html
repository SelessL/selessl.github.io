          <img src="https://i.ibb.co/JqKFCBC/me.jpg" alt="Seless" id="bio-image" class="img-thumbnail">
          <p> My name is Seless Lautzenhiser and I am a Pastry Chef in the middle of a massive career change. I've
            always loved tech and I've always been fully immersed in the realm of creativity and creation.
            I was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana and have moved many times throughout my life. From Indiana to Virginia and
            an
            internship at Disneyland in California. I ended up in Charlotte NOrth Carolina in 2015 where
            I attended Johnson and Wales University and later graduated with an Associates of Applied Science degree in
            Pastry Arts. I've been working in the food industry since 2011 beginning at Disneyland.

        <p>As a new student to web development I find myself drawn more to the front end desing aspects and I am
          challenged more by some of the more complicated back end functionality. But my goal is to do my best while I
          am in this course and use what I have learned to then continue my learning and prepare myself for the
          industry. This is a drastically differnt world from baking and I am struggling. But just like I pushed myself
          to learn to bake, I know that with time and dedication, I will put the "pro" in "programer".</p>
