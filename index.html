      <p> Hey guys, my name is Seless Lautzenhiser and I am a Pastry Chef in the middle of a massive career change. I've
        always loved tech and I've always been fully immersed into the realm of creativity and creation.
        I was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana and have moved many times throughout my life. From Indiana we moved to various
        parts of Virginina which is where I spent most of my childhood. I ended up in Richmond for about 11 years, did
        an internship at Disneyland in California, and ended up in Charlotte NOrth Carolina in 2015 to attend college.
        I graduated from Johnson and Wales University with an Associates of Applied Science degree in Pastry Arts. I've
        been working in the food industry since 2011 beginning at Disneyland as a food service worker at the Pinoccio
        restaurant the Village Haus in Fantasyland.
        From there I moved on to serving
